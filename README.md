Nimbus is a powerful and secure tool designed to provide the safest and most efficient method for sideloading apps onto your Meta Quest. Whether you're a developer looking to test custom applications or a user interested in exploring new experiences outside of the official store, Nimbus ensures that your sideloading process is seamless, reliable, and risk-free.

## How Nimbus Works

Nimbus works by leveraging Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to securely interact with your Meta Quest device. The application guides users through the process of setting up and connecting their device to the PC, checks for any potential risks during installation, and then safely sideloads the application onto your Meta Quest. All APK installations are monitored to ensure that the process is completed without interruption, and no unauthorized modifications are made to your system.
